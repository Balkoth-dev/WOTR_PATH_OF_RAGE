## Changes
```
* Includes a number of changes to Demon Rage. This is now a toggleable ability that will consume a number of rounds instead of per-combat and a new icon is added.
* When you gain your Demon path, new special abilites called Demonologies are unlocked, allowing more rounds of rage per day.
* Brimorak Aspect uses a new component to fix its expected scaling.
* Succubus Aspect now properly gives a malus to Attack Bonus instead of AC.
* Kalvakus Aspect's bonus attack will only work while you have a melee weapon.
* Shadow Demon Aspect will no longer give double the wisdom bonus when toggled.
* Adds new icons to each aspect making it easier to tell them apart.
* Allows you to toggle Barbarian and Bloodrager rages while in a demon rage.
* Abyssal Storm no longer hurts the caster.
* Blood Haze now gives a +2 profane bonus to attack.
* At Mythic Rank 4 you gain an ability to use Demonic Charge that isn't a teleport. This is for instances where you can't use Demonic Charge
* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Lilithu, gaining a bonus to your Charisma as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.
* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Oolioddroo, gaining a bonus to your Dexterity and allowing all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.
* Fixes Demonic Aura so that it will only apply its damage when an enemy starts a new round instead of every time you activate Bloodrage.
* Fixes autometamagic so that it will work on spells that are not originally part of a spellbook but added later. This is important for Arcane Bloodline for Bloodragers.
* Adds a new mythic ability called Mighty Demonrage. This allows you to cast a demon spell of fourth level or lower as a swift action while Demon Raging.
* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Oolioddroo major aspects.
* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.
* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.
* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.
* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge. This is because it conflicts with Abyssal Bulk from Bloodragers, and it's not tabletop compliant.
* Added compatibility with TTT-Base and the Brimorak Aspect Fix. If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.
* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage. This only affects the new Demon Rage.
* Demon Rage now updated. You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat. This also means it will not turn off when combat ends, meaning you get to stay angry even between cutscenes!
* Elemental Rampager is now activated when you start your demonic rage.
* Balor Aspect should no longer give its intelligence bonus.
* Fixed bug with demon rage that causes it to persist when given as part of a cutscene.
