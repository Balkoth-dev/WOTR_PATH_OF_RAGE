# PATH OF RAGE

This mod is for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, it contains a number of changes for the Demon mythic path to make it a more interesting and better "feeling" mythic path, while still trying to keep it within the vision of the game. It contains a number of bug-fixes, new abilities, and a different way of handling the Demon's main mechanic: Rage.

```
## Changes
```
* Includes a number of changes to Demon Rage. This is now a toggleable ability that will consume a number of rounds instead of per-combat and a new icon is added.
* When you gain your Demon path, new special abilites called Demonologies are unlocked, allowing more rounds of rage per day.
* Brimorak Aspect uses a new component to fix its expected scaling.
* Succubus Aspect now properly gives a malus to Attack Bonus instead of AC.
* Kalvakus Aspect's bonus attack will only work while you have a melee weapon.
* Shadow Demon Aspect will no longer give double the wisdom bonus when toggled.
* Adds new icons to each aspect making it easier to tell them apart.
* Allows you to toggle Barbarian and Bloodrager rages while in a demon rage.
* Abyssal Storm no longer hurts the caster.
* Blood Haze now gives a +2 profane bonus to attack.
* At Mythic Rank 4 you gain an ability to use Demonic Charge that isn't a teleport. This is for instances where you can't use Demonic Charge
* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Lilithu, gaining a bonus to your Charisma as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.
* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Quasit, gaining a bonus to your Dexterity and allowing all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.
* Fixes Demonic Aura so that it will only apply its damage when an enemy starts a new round instead of every time you activate Bloodrage.
* Fixes autometamagic so that it will work on spells that are not originally part of a spellbook but added later. This is important for Arcane Bloodline for Bloodragers.
* Adds a new mythic ability called Mighty Demonrage. This allows you to cast a demon spell of fourth level or lower as a swift action while Demon Raging.
* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Quasit major aspects.
* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.
* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.
* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.
* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge. This is because it conflicts with Abyssal Bulk from Bloodragers, and it's not tabletop compliant.
